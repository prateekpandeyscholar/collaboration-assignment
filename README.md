# Team Greetings Assignment

## Objective
In this assignment, your goal is to collaborate with your team and complete a small GitHub-based task to demonstrate basic Git usage, collaboration, and correct formatting.

---

## What You Need to Do

1. **Create a `team_greetings.md` file** in the root of your repository.  
   - This file should contain **greetings from your team members** in the following format:

     ```
     <RollNumber>: <Greeting>
     ```

   - Example:

     ```
     221B101: Hey
     221B102: Hello
     221B103: Hi
     ```

   - **Important**: Use your actual roll numbers. Each member should contribute at least one line.

---

2. **Ensure your roll numbers are formatted correctly**  
   - Format: `123A456` (3 digits, 1 uppercase letter, 3 digits)  
   - Example: `221B101`  

---

3. **Add at least 3 unique roll numbers** in `team_greetings.md`.

---

4. **Branch naming**  
   - Create your feature branch following this format:

     ```
     feature/<YourRollNumber>
     ```

   - Example: `feature/221B101`

---

5. **Collaborators**  
   - Make sure your repository has **at least 2 collaborators** added via GitHub.  
   - Collaborators must be other students in your team.

---

6. **Commit authors**  
   - Ensure there are **at least 2 unique commit authors** in the repository.  
   - Each team member should make at least one commit to satisfy this requirement.
